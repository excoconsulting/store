2016.03.28 - version 3.6.0
 * Important - Front-end script heavily refactored to facilitate integrations with 3rd party code. Notable changes:
   - JS single-page app logic rewritten using a BackboneJS core. Compatibility with the existing PHP templating logic is maintained since views do not rely on JS templates for updating data.
   - Introduced JS API for accessing various Composite properties including prices, availability status, validation messages and component configuration data.
   - Introduced JS Actions API for dispatching model/view actions in response to key events. The Actions API (add_action, do_action, remove_action) is similar to the familiar WP Actions PHP API.
   - Introduced JS Filters API to allow filtering key app variables. The Filters API (add_filter, apply_filters, remove_filter) is similar to the familiar WP Filters PHP API.
 * Important - Various minor but critical modifications to multiple PHP template files. Please update any overridden template files.

A component selection is cleared when an incompatible option is selected in a preceding component.

 * Fix - Rounding issues with display prices incl/excl tax and prices defined excl/incl tax when quantity > 1. All JS price calculations are now carried out using 4th decimal precision.

 * Fix - Added 'composite_parent' and 'composite_children' keys to WC API order response data, to assist in establishing Composite Products parent/child item relationships.
 * Fix - Modified composite parent/child weight and dimension keys in WC API order response data, depending on the "Per-Item Shipping" option state and exact cart package content.
 * Fix - Limited use of 'woocommerce_get_item_count' filter within the front-end "My Account" area.

To avoid issues in cart when the "Per-Item Pricing" option is checked, all container cart item properties are set to their base price counterparts when session data is loaded.
 * Fix - Handling of composited products in coupons. Coupon validity of composited items is now inherited from their parents - specifically: A coupon cannot be valid for a composited item if the composite that contains it is excluded from the coupon.
